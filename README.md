Project Overview
In healthcare, the accuracy and quality of machine learning predictions are critical. This project focuses on the preprocessing and cleaning of healthcare data to ensure it is well-prepared for machine learning applications. By systematically addressing common issues in raw data, such as missing values, outliers, and feature scaling, this notebook aims to provide a reliable foundation for building robust predictive models in healthcare settings.

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project includes patient information and various clinical metrics. While the specific dataset is not included in this repository, the preprocessing methods provided in this notebook are applicable to a wide range of healthcare datasets. The steps demonstrated here cover:
- Data cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Data normalization and scaling
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature engineering and selection

Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. The instructions provided assume basic familiarity with Python and data science libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/healthcare-data-prep.git
cd healthcare-data-prep
```

Notebook Structure
The notebook, `Healthcare Data Preparation for Machine Learning.ipynb`, is structured as follows:
1. **Data Loading** - Import and load the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Analyze key features, distributions, and statistics.
3. **Data Cleaning** - Address missing values, handle duplicates, and clean outliers.
4. **Feature Engineering** - Create new features and refine existing ones for better model performance.
5. **Encoding Categorical Variables** - Transform categorical data into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
6. **Scaling and Normalization** - Standardize or normalize numerical features to improve model convergence.
7. **Final Data Output** - Prepare the data for machine learning models, saving the final processed dataset for further analysis.
